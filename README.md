# Concise RL

Temporal Difference learning. Bellman Equations. Q learning. Policy iteration. It can all sound like a bunch of random words strung together to try and make programmers sound like they're keeping busy.  I mean, bell man? Who would think that's a serious concept?

But these are fundamental and quite intuitive concepts at the heart of reinforcement learning, that are worth spelling out. I've implemented as concise as possible versions of the following in this repo.
- Policy Iteration
- Q Learning
- Policy Gradient
